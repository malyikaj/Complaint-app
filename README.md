  -Asking a question and testing a response is the heart of the program. Two players play trivia to see who can win each round and who could be the ultimate winner at the end.

Explain the technical details:

 -First, I declared variables for the points each player can get during each round. I also set variables for the amount of points in total all throughout the game. This allowed me to keep track of points during around while keeping track of total points in the game. I kept track of points earned in those variables
 -I kept track of ranking each player had and did a series of if and else statements to determine their level.
 
Explain the technical challenges:

  -Some of my technical challenges we're figuring out how to add rounds to the game considering the entire game is within 1 function. Also being able to keep track of different variables was also a challenge. Getting the game logic down with something I had to think through completely. 

Explain which improvements you might make:

  -I would work more on the CSS and animation. I would also like to master APIs so that I can have the questions to be random. I would also like to add multiple choice answers. Lastly, I could've simplified this game significantly. There was room for functions, loops etc. because my game is very repetitive and it repeats itself. 
  
Not bad for a first try!
